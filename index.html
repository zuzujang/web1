<h2>What is inviolable right to life ?</h2>
<p>In religion and ethics, the inviolability of life, or sanctity of life, is a principle of implied protection regarding aspects of sentient life that are said to be holy, sacred, or otherwise of such value that they are not to be violated. This can be applied to both animals and humans or micro-organisms; for instance, in religions that practice Ahimsa, both are seen as holy and worthy of life. The value is inherent: Life is created in the womb ( or artificial environment to mimic womb). Man does not have ability to create life; thus, man does not have authority to destroy life. It is the only way for humankind to exist.
